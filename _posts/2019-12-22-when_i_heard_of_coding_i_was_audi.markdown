        I moved to from New York City to Charlotte, North Carolina about five years ago. I began working for Audi car dealership. One day, my Manager said "take this customer on a test drive". The customer had a backpack and threw it in the back seat. We started our drive. I started to ask the normal questions I ask during the drive such as, "where are you from"?  Somehow we got on the topic of what he does for a living. He says with much confidence "I'm a software engineer"!! I had no idea what a software engineer did. That was the moment that changed my life forever. The idea of having a fantastic career with great money, free time with my family and work life balance are all great perks but it wasn't that.. He said it was a career where other engineers are very helpful to eachother through there career.. I was working in a business where every man was for himself. I became very interested in Coding. I started this journey with researching software engineering and made the Flatiron School my home. I have learned so much so far. The funny thing is, I don't even remember the customer name. Thank you Mr. customer for leading me into this better career opportunity.
